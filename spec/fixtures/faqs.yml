  content: "<p>Yes, abusolutely. First make sure you have connected and logged into
    Strafforts, then go to your 'Settings' sidebar by clicking <code><i class='fa
    fa-gears'></i></code> at top right corner of the app, and choosing <code><i class='fa
    fa-wrench'></i></code> tab, then click 'Delete' button to remove yourself from
    Strafforts server.</p><p>If you've changed your mind, you can re-connect to give
    Strafforts permission to retrieve your Strava data again. However, since all data
    has been deleted on our server, it might take a while to retrieve everything again.</p><p><b>Note:</b>
    If you are currently on a PRO plan, the PRO subscription will be gone too.</p>"

  title: How is "Best Efforts" different from "Personal Bests"?
  content: "<p>As the names suggest, 'Personal bests' on Strafforts are PBs/PRs, more
    specifically, they are those gold best estimated efforts trophies on Strava running
    activities, while 'Best Efforts' are not neccessarily PBs/PRs, but your top 100
    best bests of each distance.</p><p>For example, if your current 5k PB is 17:00,
    and you ran 17:10 today, 17:10 is not your PB/PR and won't show up in 'Personal
    Bests' view, but mostly likely to be included in 'Best Efforts' (if 17:10 is within
    top 100 of all your 5k efforts).</p>"

  content: "<p>Personal bests on Strafforts are just those gold best estimated efforts
    trophies on Strava running activities.</p><p>First please check if the best effort
    you are looking for do exist on the corresponding Strava activity. If it does
    exist on Strava, but not Strafforts, please contact me (See 'How to contact Strafforts
    support?' section).</p><p>If it doesn't exist on Strava either, please submit
    a request at Strava's support site <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'

  title: Why my activity is shown under another distance?
  content: "<p>Strafforts' personal bests are just visual representations of those
    Strava gold best estimated efforts trophies.</p><p>If you made a best 20k effort
    within a full marathon activity, there will be a gold 20k trophy on this activity
    on Strava, therefore Strafforts will pick it up and display it as well.</p><p>This
    means one activity may have multiple personal bests over different distances,
    therefore this activity may be shown under different distances in Strafforts.</p>"

  title: How to recalculate all best estimated efforts on Strava?
  content: "<p>The quick answer is - no, you can't.</p><p>Sometimes an activity was
    uploaded as wrong activity type, which was so fast that created few 1st best efforts
    trophies. Then the athlete realized it and changed the activity to something else.
    But those 1st best efforts trophies would remain there. All subsequent best efforts
    can only be '2nd best efforts'.</p><p>In order to solve this problem, Strava provides
    '<a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919597-The-Refresh-My-Achievements-Tool-'
    target='_blank'>Refresh Activity Achievements</a>' tool in the UI, which allows
    users to recalculate the best efforts.</p><p>However, the way it was designed
    is to recalculate best efforts for only this particular activity based on all
    activities at the time when this action was taken. It won't recalculate all best
    efforts on all activities in a timely fashion. This means if the athlete realized
    the situation too late, that there have 2nd best efforts, 3rd best efforts in
    other activities uploaded after this activity, refreshing the achievements will
    result in nothing. Because at the refreshing process, Strava will treat the later
    activities as 1st, 2nd and so on. But since you are not refreshing those activities,
    best efforts on those activities won't be updated.</p><p>Say for example,</p><ul><li>Activity
    ID 11111: 5k 10 minutes, 1st best efforts for 5k</li><li>Activity ID 22222: 5k
    25 minutes, 2nd best efforts for 5k</li><li>Activity ID 33333: 5k 21 minutes,
    2nd best efforts for 5k</li><li>Activity ID 44444: 5k 23 minutes, 3rd best efforts
    for 5k</li></ul><p>Then activity 11111 was refreshed due to wrong activity type,
    so there will be no more '1st best efforts' for 5k on this activity. All other
    activities will remain the same too, which means there is no more '1st best efforts'
    on any activities. If you refresh the achievements of 22222 now, it will become
    '3rd best efforts for 5k'. Because Strava recalculates achievements based on all
    existing activities as of the time refreshing is done, 25 minutes is only the
    '3rd best efforts for 5k' now. So the athlete would never get '1st best efforts'
    back.</p>"
